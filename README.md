# IP Library for CNNs

Aim of this PhD work is to propose an efficient implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks on FPGA devices.
First task will be to describe efficient convolution engines that take fully adventage of FPGA's power in terms of fine grain prallelism.

Thus, we will focus first on implementing a dataflow neighborhood extractor that will extract a GENERIC size neighborhod on streamed pixels.

May the force be with me.
To be continued ...
